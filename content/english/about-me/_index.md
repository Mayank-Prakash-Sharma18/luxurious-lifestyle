## Hello I’m Mragank Shandilya 

I’m an Academician, Blogger, and Digital Marketer  

I have worked in various fields, be it MNCs (corporate), armed forces, PSUs or private sector. 

I also have vast experience with freelancing work and just enjoy the freedom that it allows me. The freedom to work from anywhere and at any time of my choice. Moreover, it allows me to be with my pets and family. 

But I like to travel too. I believe that the best way to travel is via a bike. And the best way to exercise is via sports or bicycles. On this website, I intend to share my experiences and things that I have learned. 

I hope these tips, caveats, and information will come in handy for people who love their freedom, and want to explore off-beat tracks. If you are not Adventurous, You probably are not living! 

Regards <br>
Mragank Shandilya <br>
